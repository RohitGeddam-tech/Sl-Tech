    title: "DIRECTOR & CTO",
    text: "Could Alok be India’s best UX designer? Well, we’re not saying that he isn’t. The talented way Alok leads the tech team comes from a rich, unplumbed depth of knowledge. We’ve yet to find a problem he can’t solve.",

  {
    img: jeet,
    name: "Jeet Khandelwal",
    title: "UX Designer",
    text: "If you feel happier after speaking to Jeet, that’s entirely on purpose. Jeet’s sole aim is to use his extensive digital and UX experience to make your world a better place. If he doesn’t know something today, ask him about it tomorrow and he’ll know more than you.",

    img: kiran,
    name: "Kiran Patil",
    title: "Solution Architect",
    text: "The best way to describe Kiran is to compare him to Neo from the Matrix, a back-end architect powerful enough to make the code bend and flex to his will. That’s probably why we hear him muttering to himself “there is no spoon” while he works tirelessly on his code.",

    img: jeremy,
    name: "Jeremy Dyck",
    title: "Content STRATEGY",
    text: "Jeremy is obsessed with words. If you’ve beaten him on Wordle today, it’s entirely a fluke. His content keeps us on our toes, and brings a certain “je ne sais quoi” to what we do.",
  },

    img: darshan,
    name: "Darshan Sawant",
    title: "Graphic Design & Video",
    text: "Darshan’s ideal world is a challenge before him and the complete freedom to create whatever he needs to solve it. As he crushes our design and video elements, he’ll never say “No” to anything. We once saw Darshan design the optimal chair for eating lunch, just because he said he was uncomfortable.",

    img: rohit,
    name: "Rohit Geddam",
    title: "Front end developer",
    text: "Rohit is a super-absorbent sponge, taking on anything to do with front-end web tech. He is just determined to become the next one-man Wikipedia at the rate he's learning new skills. ",

    img: anujita,
    name: "Priyanka Shetty",
    title: "Client / Marketing",
    text: "Priyanka is our client and marketing safety net, a digital communications guru who never lets anything slip between the cracks. She left her old career and took a chance with us because in her words, “Nothing ever went wrong at my old job, and here, you guys always keep me busy”.",

    img: manish,
    name: "Manish Porwal",
    title: "DIRECTOR",
    text: "Manish, one of the “jefes” of this crack squad, is overburdened with decades of experience. As we like to remind him, he’s been working in this field longer than many of us have been alive. But he knows that when he is empowering the next generation of marketing mavens in his digital dojo, his wisdom is immensely valuable.",

    img: anujita,
    name: "Anujita Jain",
    title: "DIRECTOR",
    text: "AJ is no one to be trifled with. Oh, sure, she might smile at you, inspire you, and display unending passion for her work, but that’s all on the surface. But we see the real her, a relentless perfectionist with 15 years of media and entertainment experience. We’re all slightly afraid of her, but we love her for it.",

    name: "Rajkumar Remalli",
    title: "DIRECTOR",
    text: "Has there ever been a day where you haven’t seen Raj with a huge smile on his face? Like, ever? Rajkumar exemplifies calm under pressure, which makes sense because he’s been everywhere and done everything. With 27 years of media experience, as well as starting Magicbricks and Delhi Times for Times of India, we’re always going to listen to what he says.",
